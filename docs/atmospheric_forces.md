# Atmospheric Forces

The forces that affect atmospheric motion can be put into two main groups: Fundamental Forces, and Apparent Forces.

For atmospheric motions of meteorological interest, the forces that are of primary concern
are the pressure gradient force, the gravitational force, and friction. These are the
fundamental forces.

Newton’s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum (i.e., the
acceleration) of an object, as measured relative to coordinates fixed in space, equals the
sum of all the forces acting.

For a coordinate system rotating with the Earth, Newton's second law may still be applied provided that certain apparent forces, the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force, are included amongh the forces acting.

## Fundamental Forces
- Pressure Gradient Force
- Gravitational Force
- Frictional Force

### Pressure Gradient Force

**Pressure gradient**: Rate of change of pressure over a certain distance

> Pressure gradient = pressure difference / distance

**Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)**: The force created by a pressure gradient. It acts at right angles to isobars of equal pressure.

> PGF = Pressure gradient / density


The pressure gradient force initiates movement of atmospheric mass, wind, from areas of higher to areas of lower pressure.

- Horizontal Pressure Gradients
  - Typically only small gradients exist across large spatial scales (1mb/100km).
  - Smaller scale weather features, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, display larger pressure gradients across small areas (1mb/6km).
  - Closely spaced isobars on aweather map indicate steep pressure gradient.


- Vertical Pressure Gradients
  - Average vertical pressure gradients are usually greater tahn extreme examples of horizontal pressure gradients as pressure always decreases with altitude (1mb/10m)

### Gravitational Forces

- Newton's law of universal gravitaion states that any two elements of mass in the universe attract each other with a force propotional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them, as represeted by the equation below:

where $F$= force, $G$= gravitational constant ($6.67384 \times 10^{11}$ $m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$), $m_1$ = mass of object 1, $m_2$ = mass of object 2, and $r$ = the distance between centeres of the masses.

### Frictional force
- Air is <font color="red">not</font> very viscous, but very turbulent becase of friction.
- Friction slows and changes the wind direction -- this causes turbulence .... 

- Frictional force is caused bz the flow of the wind over the roughness of the Earth's surface.
- Friction slows down the wind
- It acts in the direction oppoosite to the movemeng
- It is important in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer

## Apparent Forces
### Centrifugal force

The centrifugal force is viewed as the tendency for a body to resist a change in direction. It is an apparent force that includes the effects of inertia for winds moving along a curved path. The directionality of the centrifugal force points outward from the center of the curve.

The centrifugal force is the opposite of the centripetal force. As we know, inertia is the physical tendency to remain unchanged. Therefore inertia causes an air parcel to “want” to move along a straight line. Turning the air parcel along a curved path requires a centripetal force that pulls inward to the center of rotation. As a result, a net imbalance of other forces occurs.

You have felt the centrifugal force many times in your life. The centrifugal force is easily felt as you travel in a moving vehicle around a corner. The force that you feel pulling you outwards is the centrifugal force.


- It is caused by the rotation of the Earth
- The force is directed outward from the center of curving motion
- It increases as the speed of the object increases or speed of the object decreases.
- It is an important force in hurricanes and tornadoes.

### Colioris force

The Coriolis force, an apparent force, results from living on a rotating object -- Earth. It acts only on objects moving with respect to the Earth's surface (e.g., the air, planes, birds, missiles, etc.). It is only significant over long distances (e.g., hundreds or thousands of miles) and long time spans (e.g., 12 hours or longer). Hence, tornadoes are not influenced by the Coriolis force. Neither is the water draining in your sink.

- The Coriolis force is a deflecting force. It acts only on objects already in motion. Therefore it cannot create wind, but it can change the wind direction by deflecting it. The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion, but whether the Coriolis force acts 90° to the right or left of the motion vector depends on the hemisphere on Earth. The Coriolis force will always deflect objects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

- We can also see that the Coriolis force is strongly dependent on the speed of the object. If we assume the “object” is actually wind, stronger winds will be more strongly deflected by the Coriolis force.

- Air currents, which exist as a response to pressure forces, are "deflected" by the rotation of the earth. If Earth did not rotate, air currents would flow directly from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. However, because Earth does rotate, air currents ultimately become involved in a tug-of-war between pressure gradient forces and the Coriolis force. The result is that air circulates counterclockwise around areas of low pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise around areas of high pressure.
