## Earth-Atmosphere Energy Balance
The earth-atmosphere energy balance is the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing energy from the Earth. Energy released from the Sun is emitted as shortwave light and ultraviolet energy. When it reaches the Earth, some is reflected back to space by clouds, some is absorbed by the atmosphere, and some is absorbed at the Earth's surface.

However, since the Earth is much cooler than the Sun, its radiating energy is much weaker (long wavelength) infrared energy. We can indirectly see this energy radiate into the atmosphere as heat, rising from a hot road, creating shimmers on hot sunny days.

The earth-atmosphere energy balance is achieved as the energy received from the Sun balances the energy lost by the Earth back into space. In this way, the Earth maintains a stable average temperature and therefore a stable climate. Using 100 units of energy from the sun as a baseline the energy balance is as follows:

The absorption of infrared radiation trying to escape from the Earth back to space is particularly important to the global energy balance. Energy absorption by the atmosphere stores more energy near its surface than it would if there was no atmosphere.

>The average surface temperature of the moon, which has no atmosphere, is -18°C. By contrast, the average surface temperature of the Earth is 15°C. This heating effect is called the **greenhouse effect**.

The Earth absorbs **<font color="red">more energy</font>** in the **<font color="red">tropics</font>** and **<font color="blue">less energy</font>** in the **<font color="blue">polar regions</font>**.
- In the tropical regions
    - Daylight is consistent
    - Intensity of incoming insolation is high 
    - More energy is gained than lost 
    - **Energy surpluses dominate**
- In the polar regions
    - The sun is low in the sky
    - No insolation is received half a year
    - Surfaces are light and reflective
    - More energy is lost than gained
    - **Energy deficit prevailes**

The imbalance of the net radiation between the tropical surpluses and the polar deficits drives a vast global circulation of both energy and mass.

## Atmospheric General Circulation

Earth has a total of 6 convection cells. Each hemisphere has 3 on its own.

From 0-30° north/south, these are Hadley cells.

Then from 30-60° north/south are Ferrel cells.

Finally from 60-90° are the polar cells.

For Hadley cells, the sun shines down at the equator. It evaporates and begins to rise bringing water vapor. More or less, it provides rain until about 30° latitude when it loses most of its moisture.

The equator area is damp and moist. But at about 30° latitude, the air is much dryer. Then at 50-60°, it’s a sub-polar low. In the Ferrel cell, air moves north at 30° latitude, then comes down at 60° north.

Air is deflected from the Coriolis effect causing the Westerlies to move east to west. Finally, the air that comes down from the North Pole is very dry. The North Pole is like a desert because it has some of the lowest precipitation rates on the planet.
