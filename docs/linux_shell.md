## What is Linux?

Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. 

An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldnâ€™t function.

### Commands: Hands-On
Once you have opened a Linux Command window, here are some commands you can try.
```console

username@system_name:~$ hostname  #name of this computer
username@system_name:~$ echo "Hello, world!"  #print characters to screeen
username@system_name:~$ echo $HOME  #print environment variable
username@system_name:~$ echo my login is $(whoami)  #preplace $(xx) with program output
