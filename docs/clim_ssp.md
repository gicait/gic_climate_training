<b>Summary</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

- Climate change scenarios are a powerful tool for understanding climate change, charting response strategies, and supporting climate policy making.

- Climate change scenarios are not about predicting the future, but come in the form of projections of what can happen or pathways of how to reach certain goals.

- Climate change scenarios are usually used in pairs or larger sets which determine their context and meaning.

- Climate change scenarios are not predictions of the future, but rather projections of what can happen to the future climate.
- The different scenarios are derived from different **pathways** towards certain goals.

- A single scenario is virtually meaningless. Scenarios are rather used in pairs or larger sets to contrast different futures and choices. For example, scenario-driven climate policy analysis relies on comparing a projection without policy intervention (typically called baseline scenario) with a pathway towards a desired goal (e.g., the 2 °C goal). Scenarios are hence fundamentally context dependent. Understanding a single scenario requires understanding the set of scenarios it is embedded in.

- Climate change is not happening in isolation, but in concert with other processes of environmental, social, technical, economic, and cultural change. Scenario types have emerged that embed climate change in this broader context of change.

## Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)

<b>Summary</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>

- Socioeconomic scenarios provide a consistent set of assumptions about societal, technical, cultural and economic developments over the 21st century.
  
- They typically centre around a general narrative about the world’s future augmented by projections of factors like population, economic activity, and urbanisation.
  
- Socioeconomic scenarios in climate change research are increasingly based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which represent five different futures with widely varying challenges to mitigation and adaptation.
</p>
</span>
</div>


- SSPs are scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100.
- They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios with different climate policies.
- The SSPs offer a systematic exploration of possible socioeconomic futures in terms of widely different predispositions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
