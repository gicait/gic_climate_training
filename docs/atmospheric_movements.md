# Atmospheric Movements

- Atmospheric forces
- Hydrological cycle and energy budget
- Atmospheric general circulation


## Atmospheric Forces
There are a number of forces that govern the atmospheric flows
- Pressure gradient force (PGF)
- Frictional forces
- Centrifugal and centripetal forces
- Coriolis force

### Pressure gradient forces

Pressure gradient: Rate of change of pressure over a certain distance
