# Atmospheric Movements

- Atmospheric forces
- Hydrological cycle and energy budget
- Atmospheric general circulation

The forces that affect atmospheric motion can be put into two main groups: Fundamental Forces, and Apparent Forces.

For atmospheric motions of meteorological interest, the forces that are of primary concern
are the pressure gradient force, the gravitational force, and friction. These are the
fundamental forces.

Newtonâ€™s second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum (i.e., the
acceleration) of an object, as measured relative to coordinates fixed in space, equals the
sum of all the forces acting.

For a coordinate system rotating with the Earth, Newton's second law may still be applied provided that certain apparent forces, the centrifugal force and the Coriolis force, are included amongh the forces acting.

## Fundamental Forces
- Pressure Gradient Force
- Gravitational Force
- Frictional Force

### Pressure Gradient Force

**Pressure gradient**: Rate of change of pressure over a certain distance

> Pressure gradient = pressure difference / distance

**Pressure Gradient Force (PGF)**: The force created by a pressure gradient. It acts at right angles to isobars of equal pressure.

> PGF = Pressure gradient / density


The pressure gradient force initiates movement of atmospheric mass, wind, from areas of higher to areas of lower pressure.

- Horizontal Pressure Gradients
  - Typically only small gradients exist across large spatial scales (1mb/100km).
  - Smaller scale weather features, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, display larger pressure gradients across small areas (1mb/6km).
  - Closely spaced isobars on aweather map indicate steep pressure gradient.


- Vertical Pressure Gradients
  - Average vertical pressure gradients are usually greater tahn extreme examples of horizontal pressure gradients as pressure always decreases with altitude (1mb/10m)

### Gravitational Forces

- Newton's lae of universal gravitaion states that any two elements of mass in the universe attract each other with a force propotional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.

### Frictional force
- Air is <font color="red">not</font> very viscous, but very turbulent becase of friction.
- Friction slows and changes the wind direction -- this causes turbulence .... TBC TBC TBC
